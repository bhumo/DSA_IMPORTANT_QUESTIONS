# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

160\. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

**Problem**

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

* `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
* `listA` - The first linked list.
* `listB` - The second linked list.
* `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
* `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160\_example\_1\_1.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160\_example\_2.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160\_example\_3.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
* The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
* `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
* `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
* `0 <= skipA < m`
* `0 <= skipB < n`
* `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
* `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

&#x20;

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?



**Approach 1: Use of set.**

**Step1 : Traverse list 1 and**&#x20;

**Step2: traverse list 2 when we find the same Node\* in set we return it.**

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        set<ListNode*> s;
        while(headA!=NULL){
            s.insert(headA);
            headA = headA->next;
        }
        
        while(headB!=NULL){
            if(s.find(headB)!=s.end()){
                return headB;
            }
            headB = headB->next;
        }
        
        return NULL;
    }
};
```

**Approach 2: Use of the length**

**Step 1: Find length of A & B**

**Step 2 Find diff = abs(lengthA-lengthB)**

**Step3 : In the longest LL , move diff steps ahead,**

**Now you will see that your remaining LL 1 && LL2 length will same that way, you will be find intersection point when they both meet together**

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        if(headA == NULL || headB==NULL) return NULL;
     int lengthA = 0;
        int lengthB = 0;
        ListNode *tempA, *tempB;
        tempA = headA;
        tempB = headB;
        while(tempA!=NULL){
            lengthA++;
            tempA = tempA->next;
        }
        
        while(tempB!=NULL){
            lengthB++;
            tempB = tempB->next;
        }
        int diff = abs(lengthA-lengthB)+1;
        tempA =headA;
        tempB = headB;
        if(lengthA>lengthB){

            while(--diff){
                tempA=tempA->next;
            }
        }else if(lengthA<lengthB){
            while(--diff){
                tempB = tempB->next;
            }
        }
        while(tempA!= NULL && tempB!=NULL && tempA!=tempB){
            tempA = tempA->next;
            tempB = tempB->next;
            if(tempA==tempB){
                return tempA;
            }

        }
        if(tempA) return tempA;        
        return NULL;
    }
};
```

**Approach 3: Without length**

**Step 1: Temp1 = headA temp2 =headB**

**Step 2 traverse till temp1 and temp2 becomes NULL and temp1 != temp2 (that means they both are pointing to different linked lists)**

**Step 3: move temp1 & temp2 one step ahead**

**Step 4 Either temp1 or temp2 will become NULL if LL1 & LL2 size are different in that case**

&#x20;    **if(tempA == NULL) tempA = headB**

**if(tempB == NULL) tempB  = headA**&#x20;

**Assign them the opposite LL head, as the reason why say tempA became NULL is LL1 length is smaller than L2. So we will point it to the larger one. and ultimately after d distance temp2 will become NULL and will point to the head of smaller one and at this point they all will have equal length and that way we will be able to find the intersection point.**&#x20;

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}

 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
      ListNode *tempA,*tempB;
        if(headA == NULL || headB == NULL) return NULL;
        tempA = headA;
        tempB = headB;
        //we add the condition tempA!=tempB for input
        /* to handle the case of single element and if they intersect
        1
        [1]
        [1]
        0
        0
        */
        while(tempA!= NULL && tempB!=NULL && tempA!=tempB){
            
            tempA = tempA->next;
            tempB = tempB->next;
            if(tempA == tempB){
                // we are adding this condition here, becuase if the intersection is not 
                // there then becaue of next if conditions we will go into infifnite loop
                return tempA;
            }
            if(tempA == NULL) tempA = headB;
            if(tempB == NULL) tempB = headA;
        }
        
        return tempA;
    }
};
```
